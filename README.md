This project is aimed to be provide **"short-circuit" to pre-processing and feature extraction with scikit-learn**
by reducing to write boiler codes.  

## Caution!

This project is under construction and the interfaces and the modules are subject to the dynamic changes.

## features

The checked features have been implemented.

- [ ] save and load for intermediate data
- [ ] generator support
- [ ] dataframe support
- [ ] dask support
- [ ] batch adaptation of transformations
- [ ] baranchable pipeline
- [ ] delayed evaluation
- [ ] prepared transformers and estimators (inherit sklearn's base classes) for frequent used pre-processing and feature
      extractions
